# Overworld-Agent

Overworld-Agent is a Minecraft plugin to create and define agent behavior. To teleport to the agent room for the guide agent for exploration use `/destination teleport AIchoice`. 
To select the agent right click on the desired agent and to start a conversation with your agent also right click on them. 
To select a dialogue option must click enter then left click on the desired option.

Alternatively you can use `/agents spawn <skin name> <agent name>` to spawn an agent (described below) or use the `/agent chat` command to talk to a disembodied agent (described below).

To spawn a builder agent use `/agents rebuilderspawn` and interact with it using the same method as described previously with the guide agent.

_**Requires Java 11+**_
